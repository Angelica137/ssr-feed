# SSR - Feed

I am building this project to learn about react-router and server sid rendering. I am also interested in learning about SEO.

This is a PWA with declarative routing using react router that supports SSR so it is loaded from te server instead of the browser.

- Declarative routing
- Server-side rendering
- SEO in React with React Helmet
